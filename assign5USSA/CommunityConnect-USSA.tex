\paragraph{\normalfont \indent Due to the fact that implementing the home page only requires fundamental HTML/CSS/JS skills we plan to work on the guide portion of the homepage remotely. To reduce the amount of time individuals spend reverse engineering the work of other, one team member will be assigned to complete each user story. No stringent deadlines are placed on individuals for completing individuals task of user stories. So long as the individual assigned to the user story completes all of the tasks by the deadline the CommunityConnect development team will be satisfied.

\section{\bf Meeting Report}

\paragraph{\normalfont \indent This week the CommunityConnect development team met to discuss some technical challenges we predict to encounter while implementing a rough prototype of the application. Furthermore the team delegated responsibilities and itemized/assigned tasks for each for each spike in the development process.
}
\paragraph{\normalfont \indent Next week the team plans to begin writing the client side code (HTML/JavaScript/CSS stack) for the CommunityConnect application. Already some of this code has been completed. This code serves as an solid foundation off which to continue developing CommunityConnect. The next step of the development process will be to complete the back end architecture for the application. The development team has discussed some potential tools of tackling this task and have agreed to utilize Node.js, Express and Handlebars as means of creating a well organized back-end environment.
}
\paragraph{\normalfont \indent The customer was able to meet with the development team this week and now the entire
development has a concrete idea about of how to realize the CommunityConnect application. We have a solid foundation off which to work, an intuitive well prototyped user interface, and well organized documentation to reference (such as use case diagrams and sequence diagrams) to help us along the development process. We expect to see a high-fidelity prototype within the next two weeks.
}
\paragraph{\normalfont \indent Kamron has completed the main HTML pages. Next week we will be adding the functionality to these pages through Javascript and database use. All of the tasks will be divided up to each team member by each user case. As each task is completed, team members will mark them as complete on the github readme checklist. Once Monday the 5th comes, we will assess how much work has been accomplished and reassign tasks if uncompleted.
